# NLP-QTM340
In the problem set folder are my homework for QTM 340 class. Some highlights of the techniques used include: k-means clustering, applications of word embeddings, topic modeling, classification (logistic regression), naive bayes, non-parametric testing, hypothesis testing, data annotation, and use bag of words/static word/contextual word representations as predictors. 
The project evaluates the dataset of Amazon reviews and answer the question of how would consumers treat reviews on functional distinct products differently? Specifically, the project aims to unravel the question by
1. Identifying the most frequently used meaningful words in reviews under the distinct categories;
2. Labeling the most frequently used words as “function related”, “appearance related”, etc;
3. Examining the characteristics of “helpful votes” among reviews written under distinct categories of products;
4. Investigating the characteristics of a “helpful note” to predict how likely a new review is going to be voted helpful.
